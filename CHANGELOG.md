[#8](https://github.com/mcfugger/dart_pusher_channels/pull/8), [#10](https://github.com/mcfugger/dart_pusher_channels/pull/10), [#12](https://github.com/mcfugger/dart_pusher_channels/pull/12). Thanks to [Nicolas Britos](https://github.com/nicobritos) for contributions.
- Added an additional member `pingWaitPongDuration` to the `ConnectionDelegate` and the parameter with the same name
to the constructor `PusherChannelsClient.websocket`. It will regulate timeout of `ping` waiting for `pong` (checking if connection is alive).
- Fixed multiple connections occurring after `disconnect` committed by multiple `reconnect` calls.
- Distinguish manual disconnections of `ConnectionDelegate` (`disconnectSafely`) from automated ones.
- Fixed: multiple socket connections while calling `connect` multiple times are prevented.
- Change: now `reconnect`'s type is `Future<void>`. (Previously was `void`).
